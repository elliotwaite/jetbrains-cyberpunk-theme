HOW TO UPDATE THE THEME

To update the UI colors:
  Directly edit 'resources/cyberpunk.theme.json'.

To update the color scheme:
  1. In the IDE, under 'Preferences > Editor > Color Scheme > ...', modify the
     'Cyberpunk Theme' color scheme.
  2. Apply the new settings (click OK), then reopen the preferences window.
  3. Export the modified 'Cyberpunk Theme' color scheme and compare it to
     '/resources/cyberpunk_theme.xml'.
  4. Incorporate the changes into '/scripts/builder/Cyberpunk_Theme.icls', but
     replace any hex colors with its equivalent palette color name.
  5. Run the builder to have the changes also be applied to
     '/resources/cyberpunk_theme.xml:
     $ python ./scripts/builder/builder.py

To run the debug theme:
  1. Temporarily copy the contents of:
        /scripts/debug/debug_theme.theme.json
        /scripts/debug/debug_theme.xml
     Into the corresponding files:
        /resources/cyberpunk_theme.theme.json
        /resources/cyberpunk.xml
  2. Then run: Run > Run 'Plugin'

To publish the plugin:
  1. Bump the version number and update the change notes in
     '/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml'.
  2. Build the plugin by opening the project in IntelliJ and running:
     Build > Prepare Plugin Module 'jetbrains-cyberpunk-theme' For Deployment
     (This will generate a "jetbrains-cyberpunk-theme.jar" file in the project's
     root directory.)
  3. Upload the generated .jar file to the JetBrains plugins marketplace.

The meaning of the names of the darker colors:
    [color][opacity of color out of 32][shade of grey behind color]
    For example:
        red9grey5 = red (at opacity 9/32) over grey5
